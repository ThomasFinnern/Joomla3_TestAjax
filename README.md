# Joomla3_TestAjax
Example to start using ajax in a component

I try to summarize parts of what i learned when i did image upload with drag and drop for the
[RSGallery2](https://github.com/RSGallery2/RSGallery2_Component) project on github .

#### State 2018.08.05:

* Beginning of development of this example

##### Intentions

* Show successful ajax handling
* Show result of warnings on server side
* Show result of error on server side

### Origin of code and ideas

Parts of what i learned can be found in Joomla! code itself and most other parts i found on stackoveflow or stackexchange. Thanks to the people answering questions there
